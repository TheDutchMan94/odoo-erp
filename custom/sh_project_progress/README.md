About
============
"Project Progress Status" module measures the project progress with project stages. Currently, in odoo, you can't measure the project progress from stages of different tasks progress. The progress of a project will help to make more timeline of your project. You can see the progress bar in the tree view, the form view & the kanban view. You can also see the progress bar of individual tasks also.
